A **single-electron transistor** (**SET**) is a sensitive electronic device based on the [Coulomb blockade](Coulomb_blockade.md) effect. In this device the electrons flow through a tunnel junction between source/drain to a [quantum dot](quantum_dot) (conductive island). Moreover, the electrical potential of the island can be tuned by a third electrode, known as the gate, which is capacitively coupled to the island. The conductive island is sandwiched between two tunnel junctions modeled by capacitors,$$C_{D}$$ and $$C_S$$, and resistors,$$R_D$$ and $$R_S$$, in parallel.
